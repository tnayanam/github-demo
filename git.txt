// Flow when repo is already created
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. install git bash
2. in bash "git version" command will tell you which git version got installed
3. in browser create a new repository in git hub website.
4. in bash, you will be at the home location  but if you want to create local copy in a separate directory
  - mkdir directoryname
  - pwd (it tells about present working directory)
  - cd directoryname
 Now you will be at the current folder/location 
5. now set the username and email
 -git config --global user.name "Tanuj Nayanam"
 -git config --global user.email "tnayanam@syr.edu"
 check if its added properly
  -git config --global --list
  it should show the user and email set up.
  
  Copy of our own repository from git hub website to local system - this is also called as CLONING a repository. (for exaple repo name is: git-demo)
   go to online and copy the repo clone address
   in bash type 
   - git clone theaddressofonlinerepo
   now this will create the local repo in system
   - ls shows the content in the pwd
   - cd git-demo
   - ls
   - now here we will see just the readme file because thats what we created and is available on the github server.online as of now. if we had more file it will start showing now.. 
   
 Which branch currently you are working on?
	- git status
Clear the bash window
    - clear
Create a new file and add content to it
	- echo "Test Git Quick Start" >> start.txt
	this will create  file start.txt and it will add the content which is in double quotes
See the content of a file
	- cat start.txt
	this will show the content of the file.
Now if we do git status it will show that there is one uncommited file "red colour"
    - git add start.txt
	this puts the file in staging area
	- git commit -m "new file added"
	this puts file in commited area
	and now our working directory is clean
	- Now do a git push
	- git push origin master  -> this push will go to master branch
	
	to go back to previois directory
	- cd space ..
	- ls tells you all the file thats listed in the directory
	- ls -al tells you all the files that are hidden is included.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
When Empty project is getting created and you have to add it to the GIT
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- git init fresh-project       creates a fresh project in local directoryname
 go to that folder and add a file now
 - echo "New file" >> new.txt
 now if you do git status it will tell you a red marked file which you jsut now created.
 now do the same steps git add filename
 git commit -m "commit message"
--------------------------------
 how to create a git ignore file
 got to the project folder and type
 - touch .gitignore
 this is will create the ignore file.
 now type ls -al
 this will show the ignore file that was created.
 now add the extension which you want to ignore
 you need to add something like *.css to ignore  all the file with extension .css
 
 PENDING COMMITS
 
 Go to a Branch
 =================
 git checkout <branchname>
 
 Get rid of LocalChanges and get updated file from server
 ========================================================
 git fetch origin
 git reset --hard origin/master 
//test
// test2
 
 Stash
=========================
Only when you dont want to commit a change list yet
but you might have something staged meaning you might have clicked "git add" and then you might have local unstaged changes also. and that's totally
fine.
just use command
"git stash"
and it will stash the changes and you will have a clean working directory.
if you want to see list of stash
"git stash list"
if you want to drop the stash you can say 
"git stash drop"
if you want to reapply git stash stuff just click git stash apply : it appplies the most recent stuff.
